Every web developer has a blog. My name is Jake Gavin and this is my blog.

Last December, I graduated from Whitman College with a B.A. Physics-Astronomy. Upon graduation, I was torn between pursuing my interests in web development and attending graduate school. I talked  with [Tim](http://timothywilder.com/), a friend from Whitman who went on to become a Django engineer, and he told me about his experience. He also referred me to other developers who had similar stories. At that point, I was determined to become a software developer.

I read blog articles about meetups, life at startups, and hack weeks. The software development community seemed to offer the fast-paced yet supportive environment I was seeking. New technology gets released all the time, fulfilling  my desire for continued learning, and people are eager to help others get brought up to speed. The one big question: Where do I begin?

In January 2014, I worked through [Google's Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) (I'd recommend it if you're looking for an introduction to Python) and started learning Django. I worked through the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/) and built an [informational site](https://github.com/jakegavin/apolo) for the Ashland Water Polo team. While I was able to quickly pick up the basics, I realized that if I wanted to reach my goal of becoming a professional developer, I would benefit gratefully from a structured  training program. I evaluated my options (online tutorials, in-person bootcamps, online mentor programs, etc.) and decided to enroll in the [Tealeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com). I'll discuss this decision and Tealeaf in a future post but so far it's been going well.  


Shortly into my journey of becoming a web developer, I discovered that almost everyone has a blog. So in an attempt to share with the world what I have learned (and further legitimize myself as a web developer), here it is in all its glory. I plan on sharing information I come across while learning Ruby on Rails in hopes that someone will find it useful. Please [contact me](mailto:jakegavin@gmail.com) if you have any questions of comments. 

On the top of the blog to do list is a review of the Tealeaf Academy's *Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails* course. Stay tuned.
